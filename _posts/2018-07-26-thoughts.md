# Forethought


# Afterthought

With mobile becoming a dominant way for people to consume web, Bookiza brings only the most natural form of book reading experience on web. We have been flipping over pages for over a millenium!

Here are a few thoughts that guide us on how Bookiza works:

- Book is a *collection* of several (web)pages, just like a website, but in case of books the arrangement or order of pages is important. Pagination by splitting content into equal sized pages is a great way to optimize for linear reading directionâ€”either forward or backwards.

- Content that is piecemealed (chunked) and neatly stacked together (paginated) makes for better readability and better maintainability along with finer control on layout issues: i.e. presentation and cross-platform compatibility. It also significantly improves memorizability for readers.
