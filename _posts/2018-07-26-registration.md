Bookiza must be registered to be able to publish books online.  


Please sign up on [Bubblin](https://bubblin.io/)â€”a Superbook hosting substrate for writers, comics makers and magazine publishers and grab your `api_token` along with Bubblin credentials. Supply the credentials when prompted to: 


```
$ bookiza register      # Shortcut: $ b z  ## See $ b -h

```


Bookiza comes pre-integrated with Bubblin's POST & PATCH API so that you can easily deploy and update your books online. Issue just one command: `$ bookiza publish` and the latest edition of your book is PATCHed live. Use your credentials from Bubblin to register Bookiza client and you're all set.


## Registering manually

```
$ touch .bookizarc      // At the root
$ vi .bookizarc         // Copy & paste the following JSON:

{
  "token": "",          // <---- Provide your Bubblin api_token token here.
  "username": "",
