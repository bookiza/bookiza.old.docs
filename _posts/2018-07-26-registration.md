Bookiza must be registered to be able to publish books on Bubblin. 


To register, please sign up on [Bubblin](https://bubblin.io/)—a Superbook hosting substrate for writers, comics makers and magazine publishers—and grab your `api_token` along with Bubblin Credentials (Account > Settings > APIs). Supply the Bubblin credentials on the terminal when prompted to, like so: 


```bash
$ bookiza register      # Shortcut: $ b z  ## See $ b -h

username: stephenking
password: *********

Registration successful.

```


Bookiza comes pre-integrated with Bubblin's sweet POST & PATCH API so that books can easily be deployed and updated from your local. Hit `$ bookiza publish` and the latest edition of your work will be `PATCH`ed on a live server. 



## Manual registration

For manual regiastration we'll create an `ArcBookiza` config object at the root of your machine:

- Create a dotfile named .bookizarc (Bookiza Arc)
- Open the file in an editor and paste the config described below:
- Provide the `api_token` from your Bubblin Account (Accounty>Settings>APIs) on `.bookizarc`
- Put Bubblin username & email on bookiza arc, save and close.

You're all set. 

```bash
$ touch .bookizarc      // At the root of your machine.
$ vi .bookizarc         // Copy & paste the following JSON:
```

```json
{
  "token": "",          
  "username": "",
  "email": "",
  
  "mode": {
    "HTML": "html",
    "CSS": "css",
    "JS": "js",
    "HEAD": "html"
  },

  "urls": {
    "registrationURL": "https://bubblin.io/api/register",
    "baseURL": "https://bubblin.io/api/books/"
  }
}


```

Set the the `token` and user details on the ArcBookiza object each time you refresh the `api_token` on your Bubblin Account.
