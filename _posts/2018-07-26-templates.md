Dive into ready-to-use, responsive and [FREE templates](https://github.com/bookiza/templates) so that you don't have to worry about layout yourself. 

It's always a good idea to understand how templates work under the hood though.

`templateName` option can be passed to `bookiza new` command to apply a layout you want. 

Current `templateName` options are:

- `comics`
- `text`
- `magazine`
- `novel`
- `super`
- `blank`


Feel free to contribute new templates from the stories you make, but *ensure* that those worked responsively [everywhere](https://bubbl.in/support). Or at least on as many devices as possible.
