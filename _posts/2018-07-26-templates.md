Choose a layout for your book with an easy-to-use layout [template](https://github.com/bookiza/templates). 


Pass the `templateName` option to `bookiza new` command and Bookiza will apply the layout you want automatically, like so: 

```bash
$ bookiza new My-Awesome-Comics --leafs 12 --template comics
```

Options are: 'comics', 'text', 'magazine', 'novel', 'super' or 'blank' to start a book without a template.

It's always a good idea to understand how the templates [work](https://bubblin.io/docs/layouts) under the hood. Contributions with new templates are welcome. Please *ensure* that the template you're submitting works responsively and is [supported](https://bubblin.io/support) on as many devices as possible. 


> We're accepting new templates for all kinds of longform. 
  Feel free to <a href ="https://github.com/bookiza/templates#fork-destination-box">fork</a> and submit pull requests per following <a href="https://github.com/bookiza/templates#rules">rules</a> for any kind of book that you may have worked on.
