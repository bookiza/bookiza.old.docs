Help is available on your fingertips.

```
$ bookiza --help

or

$ b --help            # bookiza is aliased to `b`

```
Bookiza comes with several built-in methods to help you manage your manuscript better.

The keyword `bookiza` itself is aliased to the alphabet `b` to make it easy to call methods which are aliased further as per list below:

So a `$ bookiza new MY-AWESOME-BOOK -l 12` can be shortened to `$ b n MY-AWESOME-BOOK -l 12`.
