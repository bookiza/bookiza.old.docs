Let's create a fresh barebones book project called `happy-feet`, like so:


```
$ bookiza new happy-feet --leafs 4 --template comics
```

Or in shortform: 

```
$ b n happy-feet -l 4 -t comics
```

Bookiza will bootstrap your project ground up as shown below:


```
Initializing…  [ manuscript=abba | leafs=4 | template=comics ]
License.txt… :added.
.gitignoring /build /node_modules… :done.
README initialization… :success.
Applying a comics layout… :success.
Mobilizing crust… :success.
Server setup… :completed.
PackageJson configured… :standing by for installation.
Setting bookrc values… :done.
Generating [ 8 ] blank page(s)… : done.

…
…

Installed npm modules… :successfully.

Publish new repo as marvindanig/happy-feet? (Y/n) // n to skip.

```

The project has the following directory structure:

```

$ cd happy-feet && ls -ltra

README.md         crust             node_modules        trash
assets            gulpfile.js       package-lock.json   .bookrc
build             license.txt       package.json        .gitignore
cover             manuscript        templates           .git

```

## Manuscript
Now, as an author of the book or its maker, most of your time developing the story will be spent inside the `manuscript` folder. In this directory you'll see a subfolder for each page of the book with a number appended to its foldername, like so: `page-1`, `page-2`, `page-3`… and so on until page-2N. 

Inside each page subdirectory, you'll find files like `body.html` and `style.css` that go into composing a given page on the book. You can sprinkle some javascript on the page using a `scripts.js` file and include a head resource using a `head.html` file if it is required. Bookiza will pick-up the contents of these files, combine them and generate a page using the specified [components](https://bubblin.io/docs/structure.html) on your book.   

See how to use [preprocessors]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-07-26-preprocessors.md %}) instead of plain markup and style by altering Bookiza's mode.



## Layout
The `templates` folder is where all the layout and structure level markup and scripts live. Code and style rules placed inside `templates` folder get applied across all the pages of a book, so this is an ideal place to choose web-fonts and typography on your book.

Learn more about [strong layout](https://bubblin.io/docs/layouts) templates.

## Assets

Assets folder is where all your static assets like images, illustrations or libraries of the book (or comics or magazine) will go. As a convention the `assets` folder will not hold the Cover and Banner art of your book though. 

All resources need to be checked-in and hot-linked via `rawgit` or an asset hosting provider like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/invites/lpov9zyyucivvxsnalc5/ol3vwq9ouquwqhg5etjd) (recommended referral link). Using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to deliver images at right resolution and size dynamically helps your readers get to reading the book faster, especially on high latency networks.


## Cover

The cover-art (450px x 610px) for your book and its banner (1400px x 800px) will go into the `Cover` folder. These images are uploaded via the Cover page of your Superbook on Bubblin.
