Managing your manuscript is very easy with Bookiza.

Bookiza will watch for changes on your manuscript and reload the book on your browser automatically. To initialize a `new` project (book, comics, magazine or anything else) with exactly `2N` number of pages, pass the `--leafs` option with the value of `N` and a `--template` option if required, like so:


```bash
$ bookiza new MY-AWESOME-BOOK -l 12 -t comics   # Creates project with 24 pages (12 leafs) inside `manuscript/`.
$ cd MY-AWESOME-BOOK && bookiza server          # Opens http://localhost:4567 on your browser!
```

The Bookiza `new` command will set up your project, bootstrap the manuscript (leafs) along with necessary configuration and layout template that you chose to apply. Bookiza will also install (`$ npm install`) all the dependencies of your project, initialize a `git` repository for the project and then seek a confirmation from you to commit it onto Github.

The entire process is automatic.

Inside the `manuscript/` folder you'll find that `2N` number of blank pages (directories) have been created. This is the place where you'll be most of your time writing a story.
