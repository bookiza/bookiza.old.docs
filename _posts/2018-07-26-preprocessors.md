Bookiza comes in multiple flavors. 

Write your book using Markdown, Haml (recommended), Pug, Sass, Less, Stylus or simply plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can choose different combinations for different books and also vary the preprocessing pipeline at component or page-level. 

## Configuring Preprocessors:

There are two ways to choose preprocessing (or none) for your Superbooks:

1. Globally, using ArcBookiza `mode` i.e. property on `.bookizarc` object called `mode`, or
2. Locally, per Superbook, using the `.bookrc` `mode` object.


### Using the .bookrc mode.

Default configuration of Bookiza is set on building blocks of web i.e. plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This can be changed on your Superbook by altering the `mode` property on `.bookrc` file at the root of your project. Note, the output i.e. build off Bookiza is always going to be HTML, CSS and JavaScript no matter what preprocessor setting, logic or transformation you may have applied via the `.bookrc` or ArcBookiza. 


Here is a sample mode object `.bookrc` on our Superbook for [Bookiza Documentation](https://github.com/marvindanig/bookiza-framework) that uses `haml` and `scss` instead of plain html and css.

```json
{
  "mode": {
    "HTML": "haml",
    "CSS": "scss",
    "JS": "js",
    "HEAD": "html"
  },
  "name": "Bookiza Documentation",
  "type": "text",
  "book_id": 167
}
```




Configuring bookiza will set its `generators` and `renderers` to use the appropriate templating engine (or preprocessor) for its pages *and* templates.
