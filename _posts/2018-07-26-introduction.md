Welcome to official documentation on [Bookiza Abelone](https://bookiza.io)—the *book reification tool* for web. 

This site is also available as a [Superbook](https://bubbl.in/cover/bookiza-framework-by-marvin-danig) if you prefer reading that way. It is important to note that Bookiza is currently in great state of flux and many of the features and options described below are expected to change or be removed completely.

### What is Bookiza?

Bookiza is a *book reification framework* that cuts down your book writing and publishing time by half. By **half**, no less! It lets you manage your manuscript smartly and bakes in all the goodness of the web into your book. Produce delightful books that work everywhere. See [support](https://bubblin.io/support) information.

### Who is it meant for?

Professional writers, comics or magazine makers and artists—ala, people who publish longform regularly.

Bookiza uses the terminal environment (shell) to work. If you're uncomfortable about using shell commands or don't understand what a terminal app is consider using Bubblin's in-browser [editor](https://bubblin.io/docs/setup) instead.
