### What is Bookiza?

Bookiza is a *book reification framework* that cuts down your book writing and publishing time by half. By **half**, no less! Manage your manuscript smartly and bake in all the goodness of web inside your book. Using Bookiza is like app development, where the story _is_ the app. You can call it 'book development' for the web, if you will. ðŸ˜‡

Print delightful books on web for everyone and not just those who own a Kindle or an iPad. See [support](https://bubblin.io/support) information for broader picture.

### Who is it meant for?

Professional writers, comics or magazine makers and artistsâ€”ala, people who publish longform regularly.

Bookiza uses the terminal environment (shell) to work. If you're uncomfortable about using shell commands or don't understand what a terminal app is, consider using Bubblin's in-browser [book editor](https://bubblin.io/docs/setup) instead.
