Bookiza comes with several built-in "book baking" methods. 


Here's a complete chain of commands:

```bash
$ bookiza new MY-AWESOME-NEW-COMICS -l 12 -t comics         # Creates new project for comics with 24 pages
```
```bash
$ bookiza server                                            # Fire up the server, load book to localhost:4567
```
```bash
$ bookiza insert 7 -l 4                                     # Insert 8 blank pages starting at page_no. 7
```
```bash
$ bookiza add -l 4                                          # Appends 8 blank pages to the book
```
```bash
$ bookiza remove 3                                          # Removes page_no 3 and moves its content to `trash/`
```
```bash
$ bookiza move 30 4                                         # Moves page_no 30 to page_no 4
```
```bash
$ bookiza length                                            # Returns current length of the book
```
```bash
$ bookiza render                                            # Build manuscript 
```
```bash
$ bookiza register                                          # Connect Bookiza with Bubblin Client
```
