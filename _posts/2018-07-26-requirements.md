Any. Bookiza is compatible with the following operating systems:

### Terminal

Access to shell environment or the terminal application.

Users on Windows may need to install a unixy-style shell interface like [Powershell](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh847837.aspx), [Babun](http://babun.github.io/), [Cmnder](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder) or [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/). Mac & linux have what is called the `terminal` app or the bash or the shell.
