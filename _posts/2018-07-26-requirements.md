You'll require a desktop with at least the following configuration:

### Operating Systems: 

Bookiza works on a machine with any operating system. The only requirement is to have access to shell environment or the terminal application.

- MacOS 
- Linux
- Windows 

Users on Windows will also need to install a unixy-style shell interface like [Powershell](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh847837.aspx), [Babun](http://babun.github.io/), [Cmnder](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder) or [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/). Mac & linux have what is called the `terminal` app or the bash or the shell. 

### Memory 
Minimum 2G RAM 

### Browser
Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari or MS Edge. Having older versions of IE alongside is also recommended for *testing*.
